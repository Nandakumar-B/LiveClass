# LiveClass
It is a web platform for taking live HTML classes in which the content of the teacher's mobile/laptop screen can be shared with students. Therefore, students can observe changes in the output and interact with the UI created by the teacher.
More about this project,
1. The ACE editor library is used for code syntax highlighting.
2. Google Firebase database is used for authentication and live communication.
3. There are two modes available on this website. One is the student mode and the other is the teacher mode.
4. Authentication is mandatory for teachers, but students are not required to be authenticated on this site.
5. Students and teachers have two windows on their screen, one is the editor window showing the code written by the     teacher and the other is the output window.
6. Students will not be able to edit the code written by the teacher. But they can interact with the UI (output) created by the teacher.
